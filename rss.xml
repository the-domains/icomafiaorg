            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Stablecoins: designing a price-stable cryptocurrency</h1><p>A useful currency should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies excel at the first, but as a store of value or unit of account, they&apos;re pretty bad. You cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20% on a normal day.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*PovHvcYtqeuKC8vXhZlrXg.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Smart Contracts Might Not Be as Smart as You Think</h1><p>Smart contracts are supposed to be just that: smart. However, some smart contracts currently circulating aren&apos;t quite making the grade - with vulnerabilities exposing millions of dollars worth of Ethereum to potential theft. Smart contracts are computer protocols meant to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the execution of contracts.</p><img src="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/as-ethereum-dollar.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Digital Currency and Blockchain: How are Financial Institutions Responding?</h1><p>Perhaps the industry most obviously threatened by blockchain is banking and financial services. Digital currencies and blockchain platforms are by nature in the business of putting financial overlords out of business. If individuals and institutions can transact directly at a significantly lower cost due to the removal of exchange middlemen, then there is less of a need for traditional banks and other controllers of the money game.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*oWw1LbUgewXGY5uLrpI80A.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Coinbase is erratically overcharging some users and emptying their bank accounts</h1><p>A growing number of Coinbase customers are complaining that the cryptocurrency exchange withdrew unauthorized money out of their accounts. In some cases, this drained their linked bank accounts below zero, resulting in overdraft charges. In a typical anecdote posted on Reddit, one user said they purchased Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin for a total of $300 on February 9th.</p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58709295/846660080.jpg.0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
