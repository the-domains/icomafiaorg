            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Stablecoins: designing a price-stable cryptocurrency</h1><p>A useful currency should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies excel at the first, but as a store of value or unit of account, they&apos;re pretty bad. You cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20% on a normal day.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*PovHvcYtqeuKC8vXhZlrXg.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Smart Contracts Might Not Be as Smart as You Think</h1><p>Smart contracts are supposed to be just that: smart. However, some smart contracts currently circulating aren&apos;t quite making the grade - with vulnerabilities exposing millions of dollars worth of Ethereum to potential theft. Smart contracts are computer protocols meant to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the execution of contracts.</p><img src="http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/as-ethereum-dollar.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Digital Currency and Blockchain: How are Financial Institutions Responding?</h1><p>Perhaps the industry most obviously threatened by blockchain is banking and financial services.

If individuals and institutions can transact directly at a significantly lower cost due to the removal of exchange middlemen, then there is less of a need for traditional banks and other controllers of the money game.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*oWw1LbUgewXGY5uLrpI80A.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
