  According to Sirin, all Finney devices (there's an all-in-one PC coming, too)
  will form an independent blockchain network powered by IOTA's Tangle
  technology. The network will operate without centralized backbones or mining
  centers cluttering up the transaction process, using the SRN token as its
  default currency (only SRN token holders will be able to purchase the device).
