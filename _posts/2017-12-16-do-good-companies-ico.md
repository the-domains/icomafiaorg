  There has been a veritable explosion in the use of initial coin offerings
  (abbreviated ICO, sometimes also referred to as a token generating event or
  TGE, or a WTFLOL) to fund startups. Calculating the total investment in these
  offerings is complicated, but Coindesk puts the total right now at about $3.8
  billion cumulatively, with the bulk invested in 2017.
