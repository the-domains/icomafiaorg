  Perhaps the industry most obviously threatened by blockchain is banking and
  financial services. Digital currencies and blockchain platforms are by nature
  in the business of putting financial overlords out of business. If individuals
  and institutions can transact directly at a significantly lower cost due to
  the removal of exchange middlemen, then there is less of a need for
  traditional banks and other controllers of the money game.
