  readings and resources. It's organized from building blocks and basics;
  foundations (& history); and key concepts - followed by specific topics such
  as governance; privacy and security; scaling; consensus; cryptoeconomics and
  investing; fundraising and token distribution; decentralized exchanges;
  stablecoins; and cryptoeconomic primitives (crytocollectibles, curation
  markets, games).
