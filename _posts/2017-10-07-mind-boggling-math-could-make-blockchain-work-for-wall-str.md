  A major breakthrough in cryptography may have solved one of the biggest
  obstacles to using blockchain technology on Wall Street: keeping transaction
  data private. Known as a " zero-knowledge proof," the new code will be
  included in an Oct. 17 upgrade to the ethereum blockchain, adding a level of
  encryption that lets trades remain private.
