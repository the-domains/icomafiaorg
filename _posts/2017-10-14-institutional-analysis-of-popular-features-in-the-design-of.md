  In this short post, which is a part of a work-in-progress on a paper with a
  similar title, I'll try to provide an economic analysis, mostly from an
  institutionalist perspective, on a few popular features of
  crypto-token-economies. The main features which will be under the
  "institutional microscope" are hard-caps, and token reserves and injection
  policy of ecosystems' initiators.
