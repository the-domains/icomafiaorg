  How to design for trust around a "trustless" technology. Blockchain technology
  is redefining the concept of trust and transforming how we think about the
  structures of everyday life, from identity to economics, and government. It
  pushes designers to think systemically and at larger scales - redefining our
  role and value on teams that are committed to building the decentralized
  future.
